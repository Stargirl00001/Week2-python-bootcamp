# Week2-python-bootcamp
This week was all about learning how to make decisions in code and how to write reusable blocks using functions. I practiced using conditionals like `if`, `elif`, and `else`, and worked with loops to repeat tasks. I also learned how to define my own functions to keep code clean and organized.
## Objectives
- Use conditionals to control program flow
- Write and use loops to repeat actions
- Create simple functions and understand return values
- Combine logic and structure to solve problems.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered

- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- `for` and `while` loops
- Writing and calling functions
- Using logical operators like `and`, `or`, `not`

## ðŸ’» What I Built

- **Voting Eligibility Checker:** A simple program that checks if someone can vote based on their age.
- **Multiplication Table Generator:** Prints the multiplication table for any number using a loop.
- **Number Guessing Game:** A fun game where the user guesses a randomly chosen number.
- **Even/Odd Checker Function:** A function that checks if a number is even or odd.

## âœ¨ Reflection

This week really helped me feel more comfortable with making decisions in code and understanding how loops work. Functions were a bit tricky at first, but now I see how powerful they are for organizing my code. Iâ€™m excited to see how Iâ€™ll use these skills in bigger projects as I move forward!

Looking forward to Week 3! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
